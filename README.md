# MathmaticFanatic
_A swen-anigans project_

## Purpose

Mathmatic fanatic is an Android Application developed to help child students who are either
struggling to learn their multiplication tables or want additional practice. This application
is not meant to replace school teachings, merely to suppliment it. 

## Getting Started:
1. Since this repository only contains the app folder of the android application, the first thing we need to do is create the android project correctly
  1. Open Android studio and click "create new project"
  2. In "Application name" type in "MathematicFanatic" and in "Company Domain" type in "swen_anigains"
  3. Check off "Phone and Tablet" and select "API 23: Android 6.0(Marshallow)" in the Minimum SDK dropdown.
  4. Select "Add No Activity" and click finish.
2. Then with your favorite git client (I used git bash), add this repo as a remote to your project then pull 'origin master'. With git commandline I did:
   ```
      git remote add origin https://github.com/sklei2/MathematicFanatic.git
      git pull origin master
   ```
   
   and it seemed ok.
   
   You may be able to clone, but it would probably involve moving folders around so your cloned app folder is in the android application.
   
3. After you get everything make sure to create an emulator that is running the API Above. 
  1. Tools->Android->AVD Manager
  2. Create Virtual Device
  3. Select a phone device
  4. Make sure you choose the API from above.
  5. Give it a name and finish.
4. Try to run the application and see if the "MathematicFanatic" Application Appears.
5. If it does you're ready to go!!!
